                The roadmap of the project is divided into stages, all of which have a clear plan and schedule.<br/><br/>
                The project financing is organised in instalments. Each of the stages is accompanied by a thorough report, which contains the actual results and achievements of the team.<br/><br/>
                Smart contracts are used in such a way that the team is able to access the money only if they have completed the previous stage successfully.<br/>
                Having analysed the report, investors can vote for further transactions or against them.
